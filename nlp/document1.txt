Nutrient Recovery Research Challenge: State of the Knowledge 

1.0  Challenge Statement 
 

Extracting resources from wastewater is not new.Producing fit-for-purpose water; 
making beneficial use of biosolids, and generating energy from digester gas is now 
commonplace in the wastewater treatment industry.Recently, however, a new category of 
processes have emerged that extract specific chemical compounds, with market value, from 
wastewater treatment streams.These processes include those already commercially available 
such as struvite harvesting to produce high quality slow-release fertilizer, and those that are not 
yet commercially available such as biologically-deriving polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from 
biological nutrient removal activated sludges to produce thermoplastics, and using digester gas to 
produce methanol or ammonia.There is a need to document these benefits, the current 
technologies and processes, and to further investigate the potential value of these and other 
processes used to derive useful materials from wastewater so that WERF subscribers can make 
informed decisions as to whether these processes could be considered reasonable investments to 
their agency or company.To date, WERF has not directly funded research in this emerging area 
of importance to its subscribers, so subscribers are left with the task of researching each process 
on their own to determine if a given process fits well with their agency or company.Recognizing that wastewater is a "re-n-e-w-able" resource, this challenge will begin with 
the recovery of nutrients.It will provide needed research to identify the full range of nutrient 
extracting processes and how this resource can be commoditized.It will identify areas where 
new processes might still be developed; evaluate each of these processes for current and future 
potential; identify paths and barriers for process implementation;, and develop a tool allowing 
subscribers easy access to the information collected and created by this effort so that they can 
readily decide whether the process of interest has a net value to their agency or company, or not.Process analyses will not only include potential net revenues to subscribers, but also: potential 
cost savings, current and future process sustainability (not only the new process evaluated but 
also sustainability of current processes such as biosolids reuse), creation or use of "green" 
attributes, and other concerns important to WERF subscribers.While new processes might not be 
feasible for many utilities, implementing demonstrated technologies allows our water industry to 
become more sustainable.Demonstration of benefits of existing technologies to improve their 
implementation industry-wide is therefore an important component of this challenge.2.0   Background and Rationale / History of the Challenge 

Subscribers identified the recovery of useful products from wastewater and solids as one 
of their top outcomes in the WERF Virtual Research Forum - Futures Session (2009) (and in the 
subsequent 2010 Subscriber Survey).The recovery of useful products from a wastewater treatment facility is a challenge 
focused on both the understanding of current resource markets and technologies and also 
identifying the future commodities and value added products that will drive future directions in

the industry.The key components to advancing resource recovery from wastewater are the need 
to identify the key resources that can be recovered, identify the markets for those resources, and 
document the effectiveness of current technologies or develop new technologies for their 
recovery.Evaluation of current resource recovery options (e.g., biosolids use, nutrient recovery), 
as well as identifying the next generation resources (e.g.biopolymers, trace metals, chemicals, 
nutrients (beyond phosphorus and nitrogen)) that are cost effectively recoverable, are both large 
needs in the wastewater treatment industry.A difficult challenge is not only identifying resources, but also assessing the practicality 
of recovering resources from wastewater.One measure of practicality is to assess the monetary 
value (or revenue generation potential) of resource components in wastewater that is received 
and treated by municipal utilities on a typical daily basis.Potential resources have a wide range 
of internal revenue generation potential.Table 1 shows a brief sampling of potential revenue 
generation for a 10 MGD treatment facility, with the resources bound in solids, liquids or both 
(more details on potential revenue from a range of metals and nutrients can be found in 
Appendix A).Prices of these commodities can be volatile, some markets are quite limited, and 
the costs to extract these resource components from wastewater (including scale-up and 
marketing) is likely to be much higher than costs of mining and processing from current sources.In the case of nutrients, the availability of readily minable phosphorus rock and the volatility of 
the natural gas market will drive the overall costs of nitrogen and phosphorus.Resource recovery 
is not likely to be a major revenue stream for WWTFs, but rather it may help offset treatment 
costs to meet current and future environmental goals.For example, the revenue generated from 
struvite recovery may help off-set the cost of meeting nutrient discharge regulations which are 
being implemented around the world.Identifying the full value of useful products produced from 
wastewater, and how these products fit into a systems level approach for resource management 
will be critical in the advancement of technologies to recover these resources.It may also be 
necessary to focus on separate or new streams for recovery of useful products from wastewater 
(i.e., source separation, industrial wastes, liquids treatment, solids treatment, etc.).Table 1.Example Revenue Generation Potential for Resources for a 10 MGD WWTF.Resource

While resource recovery is thought of as an emerging field, several key areas have been 
and are being further developed in the industry.Beneficial reuse of solids has long been a focus 
and desire in the field of wastewater treatment.Several WERF studies have focused on biosolids.Properly treated, biosolids represents a resource rich soil conditioner that contains essential 
nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus, trace minerals, carbon, etc.)and provides significant soil 
water holding capacity enhancement.These qualities can significantly improve crop growth and 
yields, reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, and allow communities to balance needs for 
sanitation and public health protection with environmentally sound and sustainable methods of 
residuals management (WEF Q&A Factsheet "Land Application and Composting of Biosolids", 
May 2010).Despite these efforts, significant challenges still exist, and there continues to be a 
critical need to develop sustainable and beneficial new uses for biosolids as well as recoverable 
components in wastewater.These materials have a significant social-economic impact in that 
they are created by society and needed to be handled by wastewater utilities and water quality 
professionals on behalf of society, in a cost-effective and sustainable manner that both protects 
public health and the environment.Finding value added products and potential modifications to 
solids processing and digestion to increase the value of biosolids would enable the continued 
application of beneficial reuse of solids and help to expand the markets where biosolids can be 
utilized.Increasing nutrient discharge regulations from wastewater treatment facility discharges 
has driven a movement to looking into nutrient recovery from wastewater to meet both 
regulatory drivers and to produce an internal revenue source.Nitrogen and phosphorus are 
critical components of both our agricultural system and our wastewater treatment regulations, 
and there is reason to look into recovering these nutrients from wastewater.Reactive nitrogen is 
being added to the environment at an astounding rate.Recently, issues have been raised about 
human activities causing alterations to the nitrogen cycle - especially the release of "new" 
reactive forms of nitrogen from the manufacture of fertilizers (primarily by the Haber-Bosch 
process), NOx emissions from burning of fossil fuels (automobiles, factories, power plants, etc.), 
burning and clearing forests for food production, etc.(See Figure 6, Appendix A).Phosphorus is 
also a concern, as readily available phosphorus is being depleted at an unsustainable rate.While 
the exact supply of available phosphorus can be debated, current reserves are projected to be 
depleted in this century - with some estimating that the planet will be in short supply by 2050.In 
addition, nearly 90% of the world's estimated phosphorus reserves found in just five countries: 
Morocco, China, South Africa, Jordan and the U.S. Reducing use of synthetic chemical 
fertilizers through more sustainable methods, such as properly treated biosolids or struvite 
precipitation, is an area that becomes more compelling in light of these global trends.A need for both a dissemination and evaluation protocols for existing resource recovery 
technologies, as well as identifying the next generation of resources to be recovered and how to 
recover them exists at this time.A focus on providing a means to evaluate current resource 
recovery technologies, identify the next markets and value added products, and evaluating 
technologies and processes to produce the value added commodities that the market is seeking 
appear to be large needs in the wastewater treatment industry.A more holistic approach that

includes source separation, industrial waste management, liquids treatment, solids treatment, etc.will also be needed.Subscriber Drivers Supporting this Challenge 

While WERF Subscribers are being pressured to control or eliminate rate increases (their 
primary source of revenue), capital and operating costs are increasing.At the same time, more 
and more Subscribers are facing increased Regulatory requirements, such as stricter nutrient 
discharge limits, and there is a need for more sustainable wastewater treatment processes, such as 
biosolids management practices.More recently, there is a desire by Subscribers to become more 
"Green" by reducing carbon footprints, reducing consumption of resources, and recycling or 
beneficially using more of what we currently consider wastes.Sustainable Biosolids Management Practices 

The U.S. EPA estimates that more than 7 million dry tons of solids (45 million cubic 
yards) are generated annually for use or disposal by the >16,000 municipal wastewater treatment 
facilities nationwide (U.S.).Decreasing landfill capacity 
(www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw07-rpt.pdf) has caused regulators to require 
increasingly more recycling and diversion from landfills.For many communities, land 
application represents a cost-effective and viable option compared to land-filling or incineration.However, decreasing farmland (40 million acres of cropland was lost between 1997 and 2007 per 
USDA http://www.ers.usda.gov/statefacts/us.htm, i.e., more area than the state of Georgia) and 
encroaching housing developments make it more and more difficult to recycle wastewater 
residuals with increasing resistance from urban and suburban residents.Meeting Subscriber Needs 

There are four primary areas where this challenge can meet Subscriber's needs by providing: 

1.New Innovative Ways to Beneficially Use Biosolids 
* To provide needed sustainable long-term and cost-effective management practices 
* To provide cost savings 

2.New Innovative Nutrient Recovery and Use Methods 
* To provide cost savings, with (a) lower cost nutrient removal methods, (b) struvite 

control, (c) reduced biosolids produced 
* Potential Revenue Stream 
* Provides Green attributes 

3.New Innovative Metals Recovery and Use Methods 
* Provides potential revenue stream 
* May provide a regulatory benefits - such as cleaner biosolids and effluent 

4.Innovative Methods to Recover and Use Other Useful Materials (such as thermoplastics  
            from biophosphate polymers, or methanol and ammonia from digester gas, etc.)* Potential revenue stream

* Reuse/recovery of phosphorus or some other pollutant 
* Provides Green attributes 

 
3.0   Desired Outcomes and Objectives of a Research Program 

Background 
Wastewater contains a wide range of inorganic (nutrients, micronutrients, metals, grit, 

water itself, etc.)and organic components (biopolymers, biosolids, other carbon-based 
compounds, etc.)both before and after treatment that can potentially be beneficially recovered.Further, certain wastewater components can potentially be used to produce raw materials for 
further processing into valuable end-products (e.g., biofuels from algal production, animal feed 
and fermentation feedstocks from higher plant production).However, a complete list of potentially recoverable products and feedstocks does not 
currently exist.Furthermore, the value of many of the potentially recoverable components and 
products is, to a large extent, unknown.Currently, there is a wide range of both established and 
emerging technologies at differing stages of development that could be applied for the recovery 
of resources from wastewater and associated biosolids.There also appears to be some public and 
institutional concern regarding the wisdom and safety in resource recovery from wastewater and 
biosolids.In addition, there is a need for specific research to support public education and 
outreach to demonstrate the value of resource recovery and its compatibility with the traditional 
role of wastewater treatment in protecting public health and environmental quality.This type of 
research must be done in collaboration with public health officials and not-for-profit groups that 
are concerned about the possible risks of resource recovery from wastewater and biosolids.This research program will assess the status of wastewater industry resource recovery 
technology developments in a systematic manner and prioritize them according to business 
needs, current and future value of the recovered or produced material and perceived degree of 
difficulty in bringing the technology to the marketplace within existing technical and 
social/political constraints.A specific outcome of the program can be to identify market and 
institutional barriers encountered by the nascent resources recovery entrepreneurs.Knowledge 
management (codification, abstraction, dissemination) is likely to be one of significant 
challenges for the program.Based on these considerations, research programs can be developed that will deliver 
short, medium and long terms outcomes related to implementing a shift in the classical 
wastewater treatment paradigm of strictly waste treatment, to one that includes  resource 
production  and environmental and economic sustainability.In the short term, this research program will identify and assess the economic/triple 
bottom line/long term viability of available commercial but yet not proven emerging 
technologies and those technologies that are at demonstration scale for their application to 
recovery and production of resources from wastewater and biosolids.In the medium term, this 
research program will support the application and refinement of resource recovery technologies 
that are at an advanced level of development but have not been tested in pilot plant or 
demonstration scale.In the long term, this research program will support the examination and

scale-up of novel resource production and recovery technologies at early stages of development 
such as laboratory research or small-scale pilot plants.Objectives 
Development of Decision Matrix for Resource Recovery 
This involves the evaluation of feasible technologies for:  
* nutrient recovery 
* increased biogas production 
* decreased solids production  
* identification, quantification, and recovery of other marketable / value-added materials 

  
This objective will also establish routes for technology take up by the wastewater industry.This 
may involve the need to identify other industries that can "absor" the products and/or raw 
materials generated by the wastewater industry, e.g.plastic, fertilizer, chemical, energy industry.Intensification of Anaerobic Digestion Processes to maximize biogas production and 
minimize biosolids generation 
Technical and economic assessment of technologies to maximize biogas production.This will 
also include options for WWTPs to separately process primary sludges from waste activated 
sludges.Technical and Economic Assessment of Nutrient Recovery (Commodities) Options 
Technical and economic assessment of technologies to recover nutrients from strong supernatant 
streams generated during intensified anaerobic digestion.Desired Outcomes from the Challenge 
* Quantification of existing and potential new markets in terms of quantities, product types 

and quality, costs, and market types and distances for a range of products (biopolymers and 
others) and commodities (e.g.fertilizers, increased methane from intensified anaerobic 
digestion) 

* Identification of commodities that can be produced on wastewater treatment plants and those 
that would have to be transported away for third parties to produce.* Identification of potential strategic alliances with other industries to produce commodities 
* Identification of quality requirements of the new markets so that quality specifications for 

the commodities from wastewater are acceptable.* Identification of the typical existing wastewater treatment processes and technologies that 

can be "tweaked" to produce the commodities that meet market requirements (regulatory and 
others).* Identification and cost analysis of new technologies that would be required to produce 
commodities that meet specifications 

* Design plan to establish a pilot plant demonstration facility for the production of an agreed 
commodity.This includes the identification and engagement of a suitable industrial partner.* Identification of suitable research agency to apply for grant that can supplement WERF's 
funds for Phase 2.8 Nutrient Recovery: State of the Knowledge - September 2011 

 

 

 

4.0   State of the Knowledge 

Literature Review 

In the past, wastewater was considered a nuisance stream, requiring treatment before 
being discharged to receiving bodies of water.As the scarcity and price of clean drinking water 
continue to rise across the world, the value of wastewater, for its recoverable water content is 
also increasing.Presently, the paradigm of wastewater is changing.Now wastewater is being 
viewed as a resource based on recoverable components such as nutrients, carbon, and inorganics 
in addition to water and energy.Synergies for this paradigm change exist in several aspects.New wastewater discharge 
regulation of nutrients such as phosphate for example, is in sync with world market demand of 
phosphate.Water reuse and recovery as well as energy recovery for WWTFs are providing 
concentrated waste streams which make recovery of wastewater components much easier than 
before.Technologies which focus on resource recovery are in operation and are under 
development for some of the many components in wastewater.There are new technologies and emerging technologies that are designed to produce or 
improve the resource value of wastewater, including better treatment technologies to produce 
various levels of reclaimable/reusable water, technologies to recover nutrients (N, P, and S), 
processes to produce marketable biopolymers and biodiesel during the wastewater treatment, 
energy recovery from heat-pumps (not associated with anaerobic digestion), and metals recovery 
from process residuals.The recovery of phosphorus from domestic wastewater has been implemented at full-
scale installations (Ostara process, Crystallactor, Phosnix processes, to name a few).These 
processes have the ability to remove and recover over 85% of the soluble phosphorus in the 
water.Crystal/ pellet sizes range from 0.5 mm to 5 mm and above.The size range may be 
important for final end use, such as, larger pellets for agricultural use and smaller for nutrient 
enhancement of water bodies.Although some utilities in North America have installed these 
systems, the uptake of these technologies has not been widespread, due to market, regulatory, 
and site-specific conditions.Knowledge base and data gaps for resource (energy and materials) recovery from 
wastewater sludges and sludge processing sidestreams are presented in Tables 2 and 3 (8.1 and 
8.2, from WERF report OWSO3R07).Where there is a knowledge gap, a "Yes" is entered; a 
"No" entry denoted that there is no gap in knowledge and that information is available.However, 
it should be noted that this table may not be complete, and there may exist research and/or 
processes that could potentially be part of the table.Additional information on some resource 
recovery work is presented in the next section "Efforts by Others".Efforts by Others

There are a number of locations where studies are being carried out with regard to 
recovery of nutrients from domestic and agricultural wastewater.Of the nutrients of concern, 
phosphorus appears to be the present target of researchers.Research on multiple aspects of 
nutrient recovery are being carried out in Australia (James Cook University), Canada (University 
of British Columbia, Ostara Nutrients), Germany (Universitaet Stuttgart), Japan (Kurita and 
Unitika Process), The Netherlands (Wageningen University), South Africa (University of Cape 
Town) Switzerland (EAWAG), United States (North Carolina State University, University of 
Pittsburgh, University of Florida) to name a few.There are numerous other universities and 
research centers involved on a smaller scale.Some of the research topics include, but not limited 
to, increase in removal and recovery of nutrients at all treatment scale levels, characterization 
and modeling of precipitation processes and its use in the development of process automation, 
and determination of parameters that affect the process.For example, in the Netherlands: SaNiPhos (struvite and ammoniumsulfate production 
from urine) was developed by GMB (http://www.saniphos.nl/), Waternet showed struvite 
production combined with sludge digestion resulted in savings in sludge handling (this saved 
money even without taking into account the value of the struvite); and "Nutrient Platform" to be 
launched to make recovery of struvite and other products possible in a country (NL) with a 
surplus of nutrients (e.g.manure) versus countries that have a deficiency of nutrients.In recent years, the focus has included recovery of nutrients from source-separated urine 
as well as dairy wastewater.Many pilot projects on new sanitation methods (e.g., source 
separated urine) have been completed in Europe with full scale application constructed for black 
and grey water treatment in Sneek, the Netherlands.The latter source (dairy and other animal 
wastewater) is of immense value as the quantity of nutrients per mass of waste is many times that 
of domestic wastewater.However, research is still in an embryonic stage due to the requirement 
of pre-treatment of the waste prior to recovery.There are opportunities to collaborate with the 
agricultural sector, although significantly greater efforts to communicate between the two sectors 
are needed.There is growing interest (and facilities being built) to produce "products" derived from 
sewage or sewage sludge.They include agricultural crops grown with effluent applied to the land 
as a part of "land treatment systems", such as forage crops and small grain crops being grown on 
sites receiving secondary effluent as a part of systems designed to provide advanced treatment.Highly treated effluents are "reused" as a water supply to irrigate various crop types, including 
vegetables and greens consumed raw.There are also aquatic plants, such as algae and duckweed, 
that grow naturally as a part of pond and lagoon treatment systems, and in some cases systems 
have been developed to use effluent as a water supply and nutrient source to grow algae and/or 
duckweed as a crop that is harvested and used for a variety of purposes, including biofuels, a 
source of protein for animal feeds, etc.For example, in the U.S., there are thousands of wastewater treatment ponds and lagoons 
that are functionally high rate algae producers.In some cases, these wastewater treatment ponds 
and lagoons develop a mat of duckweed on the surface.Lemna systems, initiated some years 
ago, evolved from duckweed growing naturally on many wastewater stabilization lagoons into 
systems designed to maximize production (and harvesting) of duckweed as a part of systems to 




10 Nutrient Recovery: State of the Knowledge - September 2011 

 

 

polish nutrients from pretreated wastewater effluents.In more recent years systems have been 
designed to grow specific types of algae which produce oil to be converted to biodiesel fuel.Lemna Technologies, for example, provides a range of pond-based biological treatment systems 
for municipal and industrial effluents that involve algae and duckweed production, covers, 
harvesting equipment, conversion to biogas, etc.Duckweed-based wastewater treatment systems 
overseas (e.g., in Australia, http://www.dcm.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/file/0015/43143/14e.pdf) 
incorporate additional beneficial use options as animal feed, fish production, etc.There is 
growing interest in culturing and harvesting algae for use in biofuels production and to combine 
these efforts with wastewater treatment systems, including the treatment of on-farm animal 
wastes.Processed sewage sludge materials (e.g., composted biosolids, alkaline stabilized 
biosolids, and heat dried pellets) are used for such purposes as a land applied soil amendment 
product and/or as a source of fertilizer, and in recent years as a possible supplemental fuel 
source.There are examples of products derived from sewage sludge, including bricks produced 
using biosolids as an additive to the main clay mix that is "fired" to produce the bricks; the 
conversion of sewage sludge to crude oil, char, and other petroleum products.More recently, 
biodiesel produced at wastewater treatment facilities and biogas from anaerobic digesters have 
been used as fuel for fleet vehicles.Recovery of a wide range of metals and other inorganics 
(phosphorus, iron, aluminum, zinc, magnesium, nickel and manganese) as well as precious 
metals such as palladium, gold and silver; and even the extraction of various organics and 
proteins have also been reported.There are at least three categories of products that are being derived from sewage sludge 
as a part of a series of full scale projects that are currently being built or are in operation, 
including: 

* Recovery of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) from digester supernatant (e.g., 
Ostara's Pearl Nutrient Recovery Process).See discussion on previous page.* Production of biosolids-enhanced granular inorganic fertilizers (e.g., Unity Envirotech's 
fertilizer granulation process and VitAG's ammonium mix process).* Production of synfuel and/or char from the pyrolysis of sewage sludge.There are several biosolids-enhanced granular inorganic fertilizers processes.One of 

these employs a technology developed by TVA that has been used by the fertilizer industry for 
35 years.It involves pumping liquefied conditioned residuals, anhydrous ammonia and 
concentrated acid into a drum granulator, operates at a temperature of 132degC (270degF) under 
significant pressure, at a pH between 1 and 2.Proteins and other organic macromolecules 
hydrolyze into amino acids.The organics bind with the inorganic salts to form complexes and 
create very hard, durable fertilizer granules with less than 2% moisture.NSF International 
recently established a NSF Protocol P353 focused on the Unity Envirotech product that provides 
for a third party verification that such products are "sterilized" and meet the Part 503 Class A 
pathogen reduction requirements and metal limits.There are also a number of projects either in operation or under construction that involve 
pyrolysis/gasification of sewage sludge and the production of synfuel and/or char that can be 




11 Nutrient Recovery: State of the Knowledge - September 2011 

 

 

used as an energy source.A recent biosolids gasification technology review by MWH suggests 
that pyrolysis occurs at about 400-700degC resulting in the production of a carbon char while 
gasification occurs at about 850-1,200degC resulting in the production of synthesis gas, both of 
which can be used as a fuel source.In May 2009, the South Sanford Water Resources Center in 
Sanford, FL, completed installation of an integrated biosolids gasification system to produce a 
synfuel to replace the use of natural gas as a source of renewable heat energy to dry biosolids to 
Class A standards.For the past six years, the Stamford Water Pollution Control Authority, 
(SWPCA) in Stamford, CT, has been undertaking research, testing, and developing a project to 
demonstrate that dried sewage sludge pellets can be used as a renewable energy source to 
generate electrical power.This culminated in the design of a 15-MW biosolids gasification 
facility - the power plant will supply enough electricity to operate Stamford's wastewater 
treatment plant (approximately 1 MW) and sell the rest.The biosolids will be dried and 
pelletized, then converted to a charcoal-like char by pyrolysis, which will be converted to 
synthetic gas at temperatures between 875degC and 925degC (1600degF and 1700degF) that will then be 
fed to a generator to produce power.The ash byproduct from the gasification process contains 
the carbon dioxide and metal oxides in solid form can be reused in asphalt, concrete, and 
possibly ceramic tile.12 Nutrient Recovery: State of the Knowledge - September 2011
